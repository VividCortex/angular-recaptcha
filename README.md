VividCortex reCaptcha AngularJS Directive
=========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VividCortex/angular-recaptcha.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VividCortex/angular-recaptcha)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/VividCortex/angular-recaptcha/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/VividCortex/angular-recaptcha?branch=master)

Use this directive to be able to submit with XHR a form that contains a reCaptcha.


Demo
----

See [the demo file](demo/usage.html) for an usage example.

Keep in mind that the captcha only works when used from a real domain and with a valid re-captcha key, so this file won't work if you just load it in your browser.


Install
-----

You'll need `release/angular-recaptcha.js` and/or `release/angular-recaptcha.min.js`.

### Manual

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/VividCortex/angular-recaptcha/releases/latest).

### Bower

```
bower install --save angular-recaptcha
```

### npm

```
npm install --save angular-recaptcha
```


Usage
-----

First, you need to get a valid public key for your domain. See http://www.google.com/recaptcha.

Then, include the reCaptcha [API](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display#AJAX) using this script in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js?onload=vcRecaptchaApiLoaded&render=explicit" async defer></script>
```

_As you can see, we are specifying a __onload__ callback, which will notify the angular service once the api is ready for usage._

Also include the vc-recaptcha script and make your angular app depend on the `vcRecaptcha` module.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-recaptcha.js"></script>
```

```javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['vcRecaptcha']);
```


After that, you can place a container for the captcha widget in your view, and call the `vc-recaptcha` directive on it like this:

```html
<div
    vc-recaptcha
    key="'---- YOUR PUBLIC KEY GOES HERE ----'"
></div>
```

Here, the `key` attribute is passed to the directive's scope, so you can use either a property in your scope or just a hardcoded string. Be careful to use your public key, not your private one.

To validate this object from your server, you need to use the API described in the [verify section](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/verify). Validation is outside of the scope of this tool, since is mandatory to do that at the server side.
To get the _response_ that you need to send to your server, use the method `getResponse()` from the `vcRecaptchaService` angular service, which will return the string that you'll need.

The method `getResponse()` receives an optional argument _widgetId_, useful for getting the response of a specific reCaptcha widget(in case you render more than one widget). If no widget ID is provided, the response for the first created widget will be returned.

```js
var response = vcRecaptchaService.getResponse();
```

```

```

Other Parameters
----------------

You can optionally pass a __theme__ the captcha should use, as an html attribute:

```html
    <div
        vc-recaptcha
        theme="light"
        key="'---- YOUR PUBLIC KEY GOES HERE ----'"
    ></div>
```

In this case we are specifying that the captcha should use the theme named _light_.

Listeners
---------

There are two listeners you can use with the directive, `on-create` and `on-success`.

* __on-create__: It's called right after the widget is created. It receives a widget ID, which could be helpful if you have more than one reCaptcha in your site.
* __on-success__: It's called once the user resolves the captcha. It receives the response string you would need for verifying the response.


```html
<div
    vc-recaptcha
    key="'---- YOUR PUBLIC KEY GOES HERE ----'"
    on-create="setWidgetId(widgetId)"
    on-success="setResponse(response)"
></div>
```

### Example

```js
app.controller('myController', ['$scope', 'vcRecaptchaService', function ($scope, recaptcha) {
    $scope.setWidgetId = function (widgetId) {
        // store the `widgetId` for future usage.
        // For example for getting the response with
        // `recaptcha.getResponse(widgetId)`.
    };

    $scope.setResponse = function (response) {
        // send the `response` to your server for verification.
    };
}]);
```

### Contributing

Make sure you have every dependency and devDependency installed. In the root of the app, run:

```

$ npm install && bower install

```

Make sure you're not breaking anything; run:

```

$ grunt test

```

If all is good, you can push your changes.



Differences with the old reCaptcha
----------------------------------

- The _lang_ parameter in the directive is no longer used by reCaptcha. If you want to force a language, you'd need to add a `hl` parameter to the script of the reCaptcha API (`?onload=onloadCallback&render=explicit&hl=es`).
- Parameter _tabindex_ is no longer used by reCaptcha and its usage has no effect.
- Access to the input text is no longer supported.
- _Challenge_ is no longer provided by reCaptcha. The response text is used along with the private key and user's IP address for verification.
- Switching between image and audio is now handled by reCaptcha.
- Help display is now handled by reCaptcha.

Recent Changelog
----------------

- 2.0.1 - Fixed onload when using ng-route and recaptcha is placed in a secondary view.
- 2.0.0 - Rewritten service to support new reCaptcha
- 1.0.2 - added extra `Recaptcha` object methods to the service, i.e. `switch_type`, `showhelp`, etc.
- 1.0.0 - the `key` attribute is now a scope property of the directive
- Added the ```destroy()``` method to the service. Thanks to @endorama.
- We added a different integration method (see demo/2.html) which is safer because it doesn't relies on a timeout on the reload event of the recaptcha. Thanks to [@sboisse](https://github.com/sboisse) for reporting the issue and suggesting the solution.
- The release is now built using [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) so if you were using the source files (the ```src``` directory) in your projects you should now use the files in the release directory.
