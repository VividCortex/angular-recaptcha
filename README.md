VividCortex reCaptcha AngularJS Directive
=========================================

Use this directive to be able to submit with XHR a form that contains a reCaptcha.


Demo
====

See [the demo file](demo/reccommended.html) for an usage example.

Keep in mind that the captcha only works when used from a real domain and with a valid re-captcha key, so this file wont work if you just load it in your browser.


Usage
=====

First, you need to get a valid public key for your domain. See http://www.google.com/recaptcha.

Then, include the reCaptcha [AJAX API](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display#AJAX) using this script in your HTML:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/recaptcha/api/js/recaptcha_ajax.js"></script>
```

After that, in your view, you can place a container for the captcha and call the vc-recaptcha directive like this (Be careful to use your public key, not your private one.):

```html
<div
    vc-recaptcha
    ng-model="model.captcha"
    key="---- YOUR PUBLIC KEY GOES HERE ----"
></div>
```

In this case we are mapping the captcha data to the scope property ```model.captcha```. If you inspect the value of this roperty you'll see something like:

```json
{
    "response": "foo bar",
    "challenge": "03AHJ_VuvQ5p0AdejIw4W6yUKA65eRIEFiXFTxtKYD22UH9zjavXK4IYRZ8fhaGHjKXLKZa2MA-Lqeui5V9aeRWWTZSN6e1tED4gt7O77ROTcyY0Uedkc7LHzSUbLNULMcbXb2JThqLgOMvHINaoOtoniW4CepuOLG2h8s0tRUfqaQt6iUqNeWWHQ"
}
```

This object contains the two values needed to validate the captcha in your server. ```response``` is the response of the user, and ```challenge``` is the identification of the captcha that your user resolved.

The data can also be retrieved from ```vcRecaptchaService```, using the ```.data()``` method (returns the same as above), or the ```.formData()``` method (returns an FormData object with ```recaptcha_response_field``` and ```recaptcha_challenge_field```).


To validate this object from your server, you need to use one of the [server side plugins](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) or [roll your own](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/verify). Validations is outside of the scope of this tool, since is mandatory to do that at the server side.


Other Parameters
================

You can optionally pass other parameters to the captcha, as html attributes:

```html
    <div
        vc-recaptcha
        ng-model="model.captcha"
        tabindex="3"
        theme="clean"
        lang="en"
        key="---- YOUR PUBLIC KEY GOES HERE ----"
        keyExpr=" key_in_scope "
    ></div>
```

In this case we are specifying that the captcha should use the theme named 'clean', display the texts in english language and the captcha input should have tabindex 3.

You only need one of `key` and `keyExpr`, `key` has priority.


Recent Changelog
================

- Added the ```destroy()``` method to the service. Thanks to @endorama.
- We added a different integration method (see demo/2.html) which is safer because it doesn't relies on a timeout on the reload event of the recaptcha. Thanks to [@sboisse](https://github.com/sboisse) for reporting the issue and suggesting the solution.
- The release is now built using [GruntJS](gruntjs.com) so if you were using the source files (the ```src``` directory) in your projects you should now use the files in the release directory.
